### Bacteria
>Hello my name is *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and i come from a family called *pseudomonadaceae*.I am housed in a comfortable mansion called a capsule that keeps me out of danger.I love the gram's secondary stain better and i am petit some call it rods or bacilli.

>My favourite colors are green and blue and you can always see this when you grow me on **TSA** and **MH** agar plates. Our colonies are usualy raised and convex and the margins serrated. When you grow me on **5% SBA** i love to cover myself with alluminium foil so you can easily identify me.
>
>I have a strict diet but can utilize citrate as a form of carbon as well as reduce hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. Most people differenciate me from my look alikes by testing for cytochrome c oxidase enzyme which i have in abundance.
>
>I am smart as i do resist most attacks in the form of `antibiotics` and most forms of resistance are intrinsic thanks to my predecessors.
